# xdraw
C/C++ library for high quality, high performance 2D primitives, road and 2.5D roads rendering.
xdraw was a key component of Map SDK drawing engine. We used it for rendering high quality maps in 2D and 2.5D. The library initially used in Windows desktop/ Windows CE/ Windows Mobiles devices, later in Android devices. It's code mostly OS-independent.
We decided to make xrdaw open-source, hopefully it will be useful for some developers. For now it has virtually zero ducumentation yet.
